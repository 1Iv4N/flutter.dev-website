    When faced with the challenge of enabling all Nubank engineers to contribute to our app, regardless of
    specialization, we embarked on a 3 month R&D project and evaluated many hybrid platform alternatives including
    Flutter. What really sold the team was the usability tests: engineers regardless of seniority thought that the
    development experience on Flutter was simpler, with better error messages, quick hot reloads and safer type checking.
    I’m really excited about the progress we’ve made so far and the feedback from teams migrating their features to our
    new architecture” -alexandre freire.
